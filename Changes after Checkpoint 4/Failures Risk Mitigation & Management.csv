6,Network failure,Gateway fail,The gateway connecting the local network with the cloud might fail,LoRaWAN is used which is topologically star mesh and provides alternate routes of a gateway fails,"Implement redundant gateways with automatic switching in case of failure, and use local data storage with periodic synchronization to the cloud when the primary gateway is unavailable.",IF all other gateways fail
7,Network failure,Node Contact lost,Any node might lost contact from the system and get isolated due to connectivity issues,UDP and LoRa combined provides good reassurance of quality of connection,Implement automatic reconnection protocols where nodes attempt to reconnect periodically and fallback mechanisms that allow nodes to temporarily store data locally until reconnected.,Recoverable
8,Network failure,Obstruction,There might be foreign objects abstructing communication between the gateway and sensor or satellite,Many access routes are provided to a single node and messages are cached and forwarded through alternate routes,Wait for some time till connection is reestablished or else send maintenance team,Recoverable
9,Network failure,Network Overloading,Too many sensors might try to access a point and cause overloading,LoraWan supports time division and frequency division multiplexing to prevent overloading,"Use edge computing to process data locally and reduce the load on central systems, and implement load balancing techniques to distribute sensor traffic across multiple access points or gateways.",if many other gateways are overloaded
10,Network failure,Noise,There might be noise transmitted along the data due to environmental or inherent issues rendering the data unusable,Proper error correcting codes and shielding is used to prevent noise and proper processing techniques are used to remove noise,"Implement real-time data validation and outlier detection algorithms to identify and discard noisy data, and use data smoothing or interpolation techniques to recover missing or corrupted information.",Recoverable
11,Network failure,Cloud/fog overload,The Cloud might recieve too many requests causing it to become slow and get overloaded,"Rate limiting , load balancing and auto scaling techinques are used","Use a queuing system to temporarily hold requests and process them in batches, and implement edge computing to reduce the load on the cloud by processing data locally before sending only essential information.",If all clouds are overloaded
12,Network failure,Cloud/fog crash,The cloud might crash due to inherent issues,Many clouds and fogs redistribute the tasks among themselves to prevent crashing a singular cloud,Send maintenance team ,recoverable
13,Network failure,Mobile network failure,The local mobile communication network might fail due to base station or service provider failure,Multi network sims are recomendded and warning would be sent on government specified emergency bandwiths that are garunteed to work,Data buffering is implemented and when connection is resumed the message is sent,If the base station fails
14,Network failure,Mobile device out of range,the person who needs to recieve the warning might be in a signal blindspot,High frequency waves are advised for communication that have better penetrating properties,"Implement a network of intermediate relay devices  to retransmit the warning and consider physical notifications (e.g., loudspeakers or flashing lights) in critical areas",If the person is in complete blindspot
15,Data Collection Failure,Temporal resolution,"Many satellites have fixed orbits and revisit a location only after a specific interval (e.g., every few days or weeks). This limits the ability to capture real-time or frequent changes in rapidly evolving glacial environments. GLOFs are sudden events, and low-frequency satellite passes may miss critical changes leading up to or immediately following a GLOF event.","A combination of satellites such as sentinel1, sentinel 2 and others are used such that there is higher probability of an satellite providing coverage at any particular point",Wait till a satellite comes to orbit or request data from other country satellites like  starlink and others,IF Glof is happenening at that moment
16,Data Collection Failure,Satellite blocked,"Many glacier regions are prone to frequent cloud cover, snowstorms, and fog, which can obstruct optical satellite sensors (e.g., those using visible and infrared wavelengths).
 Clouds prevent the satellite from capturing clear images of the glacial lakes and surrounding areas, making it difficult to track water levels, lake expansions, or outburst floods.
",A combination of Synthetic aperture radar and Ground Penetrating radar is used . Millimeter wave radar might also be combined to provide maximim visibility,Use ground based data as backup and perform computation using that alone,IF combined with multiple sensor failure
17,Data Collection Failure,Noisy SAR/GPR,The Synthetic aperture radar and ground penetrating radar images might be blurred due to electrostatic inteference from stroms and other weather events,use advanced noise reduction algorithms,Perform post image processing to extract data,IF combined with multiple sensor failure
18,Data Collection Failure,Weather prediction fail,The weather prediction models of isro and other govermental organisation might fail and give wrong data,Rely on more than one governmental website ,Rely on sensor output and remote sensing,IF combined with multiple sensor failure
19,Data Collection Failure,Imagery resolution,"The spatial resolution of some satellite sensors may be insufficient to detect small changes in glacial lakes, such as minor expansions, small cracks in moraine dams, or small-scale debris flow following a GLOF. Lower-resolution imagery may not capture critical, detailed features required for early GLOF detection, especially for smaller glacial lakes or subtle signs of dam failure.
